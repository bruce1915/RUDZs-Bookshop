You're right — as of **May 30, 2022**, Google **no longer allows less secure apps**, which means using your Gmail password directly in your app **will not work anymore**. However, you can still send emails through Gmail **securely** by using:

---

### ✅ Option 1: Use **App Passwords** (Best for personal Gmail accounts)

If you're using a **personal Gmail account**, follow these steps:

#### 🔐 Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification

* Go to [https://myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
* Turn on **2-Step Verification**

#### 🔑 Step 2: Generate an App Password

* Go to [App passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
* Select **"Mail"** as the app and **"Other"** as the device (name it e.g., "Flask Mail App")
* Google will generate a **16-character password** — copy it

#### ✏️ Step 3: Use this password in your app config

```python
app.config.update(
    MAIL_SERVER='smtp.gmail.com',
    MAIL_PORT=465,
    MAIL_USE_SSL=True,
    MAIL_USERNAME='your_email@gmail.com',
    MAIL_PASSWORD='your_16_char_app_password'
)
mail = Mail(app)
```

📌 Make sure you're using `MAIL_PORT = 465` (SSL) or 587 (TLS + `MAIL_USE_TLS=True`).

---

### ✅ Option 2: Use an Email API like **SendGrid** (Best for production)

If you're deploying a real app, it's **better to use a transactional email service** like:

* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
* [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)
* [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/)

These services provide an API and SMTP credentials. Example with SendGrid:

```python
app.config.update(
    MAIL_SERVER='smtp.sendgrid.net',
    MAIL_PORT=587,
    MAIL_USE_TLS=True,
    MAIL_USERNAME='apikey',  # this is literally the word 'apikey'
    MAIL_PASSWORD='your_sendgrid_api_key'
)
mail = Mail(app)
```

---

### ✅ Summary

| Method           | Secure | Recommended for        | Requires Extra Setup |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Gmail + App Pass | ✅      | Personal/test projects | Yes (2FA + App Pass) |
| SendGrid         | ✅✅     | Production use         | Yes                  |

Do you want help setting up a SendGrid account or writing a working email-sending function?
